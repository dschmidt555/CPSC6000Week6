Implements a proxy.  Program allows a spymaster to set mission variables such as mission name, budget, location and target but does not allow spymaster to assign a spy to the mission.  If spymaster attempts this an exception is thrown.  Only the spy can assign himself to the mission.  But if he attempts to do anything else, such as the budget then an exception is thrown.
